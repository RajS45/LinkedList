# LinkedList

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected using pointers.
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.
Each node contains:
- Data: the actual value.
- Next: a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Types of Linked Lists
-> Singly Linked List.
-> Doubly Linked List.
-> Circular Linked List.


üß† Key Operations
- Insertion: Add a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
- Deletion: Remove a node from the list.
- Traversal: Visit each node to read or process data.
- Search: Find a node with a specific value.

‚ùå Disadvantages
- No random access: Must traverse from the head to reach a node.
- Extra memory: Each node stores a pointer.
